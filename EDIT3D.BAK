	ZeBRA 3D object editor.
	Copyright (1995) Kevin Richey

	This utility allows you to manipulate several 3D objects
	on the screen in wireframe perspectice projection in order
	to design more complex shapes.

	Make sure that the "EGAVGA.BGI" file is in the same directory
	that you are running VIEW3D2 from.

	The program has several commands when you first start:

	l	Load shape into database
	a	Add object to scene
	e	Edit object
	c	Set camera options
	q	Quit EDIT3D

	After the first object has been added to the scene, three
	new operations will become active:

	t	Translate object
	s	Scale object
	r	Rotate object
