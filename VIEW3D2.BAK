	ZeBRA 3D shape file viewer.

	This utility is used to display 3D data files in wireframe
	perspective projection using backface culling hidden surface
	removal.

	Make sure that the "EGAVGA.BGI" file is in the same directory
	that you are running VIEW3D2 from.

	Run the program with no command line parameters.
	You will be asked for the name of the object file to view.
	Enter the file name, including the path and ".3D" extension.
	You will then be asked for the camera position.  Enter 3
	translation values (x, y, and z, respectively) to position the
	object i front of the camera.  Good values are zero for x and y
	and anything above two for z.
	The object file will be loaded and displayed on the screen.
	There are four commands: s for scale, r for rotate, t for
	translate, and q for quit.  The transformation commands each
	take three floats as input.  Remember that rotation uses
	radians, NOT degrees, and that 360 degrees == 2*PI, or about
	6.28318 radians.

	Here are some useful angles conversions:
